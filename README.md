#Lab06
THIS IS AN OPTIONAL LAB WHICH SHOULD BE DONE AND SUBMITTED INDIVIDUALLY and THERE IS ONLY ONE SUBMISSION DATE FOR THIS LAB.

Follow all code styling and submission instructions as outlined for previous labs.
* Derive a MinHeap class from the BST class of your Lab 4 code.
* Define/Override only the Search/Insert/Delete methods in the new class.
* Write a new main for this lab which:
* Will only be a test program for the MinHeap.
* Declares and creates a MinHeap object as necessary.
* Declares and creates the Dollar objects as necessary.
* Inserts the 20 Dollar objects specified in Lab 4 in the same order.
* Performs all 4 traversals after the inserting the 10th and the last objects - in total there will be 8 outputs which should be clearly demarcated.
* No user input is necessary, no data validation is necessary.
* For submission - upload all class files from Lab 4 as necessary as well as your new MinHeap class and the main. Remember to also include adequate number of screenshots of the program execution.
* The Discussion forum will be monitored and responded to all week during the Finals. Office Hours will only be held on MTW. For clarifications, post your questions on the Discussion forum first.
Grading:

Since this is an extra credit lab designed to boost your overall lab score (programming labs + zybooks labs), this lab has been made optional and the following criteria will be applied:
* 10 pts - EXE created from your code works from command line.
* 30 pts - MinHeap ADT
* 10 pts - Your main

The following additional early submission extra credit can be earned:
* 20% extra if submitted one day early (i.e. EOD Thursday).
* 36% extra if submitted two days early (i.e. EOD Wednesday).
* 44% extra if submitted three days early (i.e. EOD Tuesday - remember the final is on Tuesday).
* 50% extra if submitted four days early (i.e. EOD Monday).
* The early submission extra credits will only be applied if both these conditions are met;
* Your score on the lab without the extra credit is at least 40.
* Your cumulative score on the five past programming labs is less than 550 points.
* Thus, the first 50 points is a true extra credit but the additional early submission extra credit is only a make up for past lost points.
